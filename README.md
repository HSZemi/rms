## How to play King of the Hill Regicide

With UserPatch 1.5, it is possible to play King of the Hill (KOTH) and Regicide simultaneously.
You can use the random map scripts (.rms files) in the KOTH_REGICIDE folder to play KOTH Regicide. 
Just place them in your Random game folder. If you are using Vooble with the compatibility patch, 
it is probably located under `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Age2HD\Random`.

To play KOTH Regicide, select the King of the Hill gamemode and choose one of the maps provided - 
they all have a KHR_ prefix.

All maps from the KOTH_REGICIDE folder stem from [HJ1](https://github.com/HJ1/Age-of-Empires-II-RMS-Maps-Archive) 
and have been modified to enable KOTH Regicide.
